# Blood Type Prediction using Linear Regression 
 This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict a person's **blood type** based on **gender** and **age** using a healthcare dataset. While blood type is categorical data and not typically suited for linear regression, this project serves as an experiment to analyze the effectiveness of regression techniques in classification problems.
